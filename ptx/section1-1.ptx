  <p>
    To start, we begin learning and/or reviewing some notation. Here is a table of frequently used symbols and abbreviations you may see in this book or in class, along with their meanings.

  <p>
<m>^*</m>We will discuss what this means in greater detail as it arises in our work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, the notation <m>:=</m> means we are assigning a definition. E.g., writing <q>Let <m>S:=\{1,2,3\}</m></q> means we are defining <m>S</m> to be the set <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>. We often omit the colon and simply write <m>=</m> in these cases, but we may include it to emphasize the fact that we are defining something.
